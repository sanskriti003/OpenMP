# OpenMP
Open Multi-processing(OpenMP) is a technique of parallelizing particular sections of code. It is used as an extension to languages such as c/c++ by adding parallelizing features to them. To speed up the execution of the programs, parallel processing systems are designed. OpenMP does the same but it is not an automatic parallel processing system.
<br>OpenMP uses parallelizing features and divides the program into multiple fragments and processes these fragments simultaneously making the execution faster and more efficient.</br>
